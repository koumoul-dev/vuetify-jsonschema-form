# Contribute

Pull requests are welcome, just make sure that you discuss important changes in an issue beforehand, then follow the coding style and run the tests before submitting.

Run all prepublishing checks at once:

    npm run prepublish

## Coding style

It is enforced by [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and configured in [.eslintrc.js](./.eslintrc.js), you should probably use a plugin to integrate it in your editor.

Check all rules:

    npm run lint

## Development server

Run a local development server:

    cd doc
    npm install
    npm run dev

This simply opens the documentation site in a local web server that will watch your edits to the source code both of the library and of the documentation and its examples.

Please note that you can open a single example in a lighter page by replacing the # by a slash in the URL (for example http://localhost:3133/examples#basic => http://localhost:3133/examples/basic).

An additional "Development" group of examples is visible, please add in this group examples that do not need to be presented to the users but has some value for maintainers.

## Tests

the test suite is written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Run the test suite:

    npm run test

To increase efficiency test cases and documented examples are the same thing in this project. You can complete the existing examples to cover new functionalities, or you can create new hidden examples (prefixed with "\_") to cover edge cases without increasing the verbosity of the documentation.

When running tests each example is rendered and a HTML snapshot is extracted and compared to a previous one. When the tests fail because of a snapshot diff, you should check that it is a valid change, then run `npm run test-update`.

You can also write additional test assertions in the examples themselves, see [_resolved-schema.js](./doc/examples/_resolved-schema.js) for example.

## Publishing

Release and publish using npm:

```
npm version minor
npm publish
git push && git push --tags
```

To publish a beta version, use prerelease versioning with a npm tag:

```
npm version preminor --preid=beta # use prerelease instead of preminor to increment
npm publish --tag=beta
git push && git push --tags
```
